# HTML Styleguide

## Some General Guidelines

 - Each `<section>` and `<article>` start their own header scope, so the top level heading within each will be an `<h1>`.
 
 - `<section>` tags are for major sections of page content. If in doubt, use a `<div>`
 
 - There is no need for `<header>` tags if they only contain a single element (e.g. `<h1>`)
 

## Single Article
 - A page with a single article should have a single `<article>` tag as the root of the article.

## List of Articles
e.g. a homepage, or search results, tag list, etc
